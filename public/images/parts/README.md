# Robot Part Preview Images

This directory contains preview images for all robot parts. Each image should be:

- PNG format
- 512x512 pixels
- Transparent background
- Well-lit front view of the part
- Consistent lighting and rendering style

Each subdirectory contains the preview images for its respective part type:
- `heads/` - Head part previews
- `torsos/` - Torso part previews
- `arms/` - Arm part previews
- `legs/` - Leg part previews
- `weapons/` - Weapon part previews

Image filenames should match their corresponding 3D model files (e.g., `scout_head.png` for `scout_head.glb`).
