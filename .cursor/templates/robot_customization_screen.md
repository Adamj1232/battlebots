# Robot Customization Screen Implementation

Create a React component for the robot customization screen that allows 7-10 year old players to:
- Select between Autobot and Decepticon factions
- Choose and preview different robot parts (head, torso, arms, legs, weapons)
- Customize colors and appearances
- Name their robot
- View robot stats based on part selection
- Save and load custom robots

The interface should be:
- Visually engaging with 3D preview
- Simple enough for 7-10 year olds to navigate
- Provide immediate visual feedback on changes
- Include help tooltips for each option
- Use drag-and-drop where appropriate
- Provide preset configurations for quick starts

Implement this using React components integrated with Three.js for model visualization.
