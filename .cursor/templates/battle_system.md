# Battle System Implementation

Create a battle system for robot combat that includes:
- Turn-based or real-time combat mechanics
- Basic attack options (melee, ranged)
- Special abilities based on robot configuration
- Visual feedback for attacks and damage
- Health and energy management
- Victory/defeat conditions
- Environmental interactions during battle
- Simple strategic elements appropriate for 7-10 year olds

The battle system should:
- Be visually exciting with appropriate effects
- Have simple controls accessible to young players
- Include strategic depth but remain approachable
- Provide clear feedback on actions and consequences
- Balance difficulty for the target age group
- Include tutorials for new players
- Support both PvE and optional PvP modes

Implement using Three.js for visuals and integrated with the game state management system.
