# Physics Integration

Implement Ammo.js or Cannon.js physics with Three.js for realistic robot movement and collisions.

## Requirements
- Initialize physics world with appropriate gravity (9.8 m/sÂ²)
- Create rigid bodies for robots with proper mass distribution
- Implement collision detection with appropriate callback handling
- Create compound collision shapes for complex robot geometries
- Set up raycasting for ground detection
- Implement constraint-based joints for robot articulation
- Add physics materials with appropriate friction/restitution
- Optimize physics simulation with proper time step values
- Ensure physics bodies properly sync with visual representations

## Performance Considerations
- Use simplified collision shapes for physics (not render geometry)
- Implement physics culling for distant objects
- Set appropriate solver iteration counts (8-10 for position, 3-5 for velocity)
- Use physics instancing where possible for similar objects
- Implement sleep states for inactive objects

## Child-Friendly Considerations
- Add slightly forgiving physics (less strict falls)
- Implement predictable jump mechanics
- Create appropriate collision feedback (visual/audio)
- Ensure consistent behavior for interactions
