# Robot Primitive System Overview

This document outlines the high-level design for our primitive-based robot system, which replaces the external 3D model approach.

## Core System Components

### 1. Part Generation System

Create modular robot parts using Three.js primitives:

- Generate different variations of each part type (heads, torsos, arms, legs, weapons)
- Apply faction-specific styling (Autobot vs Decepticon visual language)
- Support customization through parameters (color, detail level, etc.)
- Create consistent attachment points for modular assembly

### 2. Robot Assembly System

Connect robot parts into a cohesive character:

- Implement socket system for connecting parts
- Maintain hierarchical structure for animations
- Support swapping parts during customization
- Handle faction-specific assembly rules

### 3. Visual Customization

Allow players to customize their robots:

- Primary and secondary colors
- Detail levels and decorative elements
- Faction-specific markings and symbols
- Material properties (metallic, matte, etc.)

### 4. Animation System

Create a simple but effective animation system:

- Direct manipulation of primitives for movement
- Keyframe-based animation for actions
- Support for transformation sequences
- Combat-specific animations (attacks, damage reactions)

## Part Type Specifications

### Heads
- 3-4 distinct designs per faction
- Faction-specific eye designs
- Optional antenna or other features
- Attachment point at bottom

### Torsos
- 3-4 body types (balanced, heavy, agile)
- Faction-specific design language
- Multiple attachment points (head, arms, legs)
- Optional decorative elements

### Arms
- Different arm styles (standard, weapon, utility)
- Left/right variants
- Attachment points for weapons
- Posable components for animation

### Legs
- Multiple mobility styles (standard, treads, hover)
- Appropriate joint structures
- Support for standing and vehicle modes
- Faction-specific styling

### Weapons
- Diverse weapon types (blaster, sword, cannon, etc.)
- Energy effect attachment points
- Faction-specific design language
- Scaling options for different robot sizes

## Implementation Strategies

### Primitive Composition

Compose complex shapes from basic primitives:

- Use `THREE.Group` to organize related primitives
- Create reusable sub-assemblies for common elements
- Position primitives precisely for clean connections
- Scale primitives appropriately for consistent sizing

### Material System

Create a unified material system:

- Base materials for different surfaces (metal, glass, etc.)
- Emissive materials for glowing elements
- Color parameter system for customization
- Faction-specific material presets

### Performance Optimization

Optimize for browser performance:

- Share geometries between similar parts
- Use instanced meshes where appropriate
- Implement simple LOD (Level of Detail) for distant robots
- Optimize material usage to minimize state changes

### Robot Configuration System

Create an organized data structure for robot customization:

- Part types and variations
- Material and color settings
- Statistical properties for gameplay
- Unlockable parts and progression

This primitive-based approach provides an efficient, customizable system that should perform well in browser environments while maintaining an engaging visual style appropriate for our target audience.
