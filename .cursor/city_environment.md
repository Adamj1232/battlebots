# City Environment Implementation

Create a vibrant, interactive city environment for robot battles.

## City Zones
- Downtown: Tall buildings, narrow streets, vertical gameplay
- Industrial: Factories, warehouses, containers for cover
- Park: Open areas, trees, terrain elevation changes
- Underground: Tunnels, subways, limited visibility

## Technical Requirements
- Use instanced mesh rendering for similar objects
- Implement level of detail (LOD) for distant buildings
- Create modular building components for variety
- Use texture atlases to reduce draw calls
- Implement occlusion culling for performance
- Add post-processing effects for visual appeal

## Interactive Elements
- Destructible walls and barriers
- Collectible energon cubes for power-ups
- Civilian NPCs to protect
- Environmental hazards (electric fields, steam vents)
- Secret areas with rewards

## Accessibility Features
- Clear visual language for interactive elements
- Mini-map or waypoint system for navigation
- Consistent color coding for different zones
- Appropriate contrast for important elements
- Simple landmark system for orientation
