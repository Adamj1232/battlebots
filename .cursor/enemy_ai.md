# Enemy AI Implementation

Design and implement enemy AI that provides appropriate challenge for 7-10 year old players while encouraging strategic thinking and remaining fun to battle against.

## Core AI Requirements
- Create behavior tree system for enemy decision making
- Design distinct AI personalities for different enemy types
- Implement difficulty scaling based on player progression
- Create telegraphed attacks with appropriate reaction windows
- Design AI that utilizes the environment strategically
- Implement group tactics for multi-enemy encounters
- Create boss AI with phased attack patterns

## Technical Implementation
- Use behavior trees for flexible AI decision making
- Implement influence maps for strategic positioning
- Create sensory systems (sight, sound) for realistic awareness
- Design pathfinding that works with physics-based movement
- Implement target priority system for group encounters
- Create animation state machines tied to AI decisions
- Design modular AI components that can be combined

## Child-Friendly Considerations
- Design AI that challenges but doesn't frustrate
- Implement obvious "tells" before major attacks
- Create consistent patterns that can be learned
- Design AI that occasionally makes exploitable mistakes
- Implement dynamic difficulty adjustment for struggling players
- Create memorable personality traits for different enemies
- Design AI that rewards strategic thinking
