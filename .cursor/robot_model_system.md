# Robot Model System Context

Design a component-based robot model system using Three.js, where different parts (head, torso, arms, legs, weapons) can be swapped out. Each part should connect at predefined attachment points and maintain proper transformations.

Key requirements:
- Create a base robot class that manages all component attachments
- Define standard attachment points (sockets) for each component type
- Implement part swapping functionality that updates model in real-time
- Ensure proper hierarchical transformations when animating
- Support Autobot and Decepticon variant geometries
- Include collision meshes for physics integration
- Create preview system for robot customization screen
- Support color/texture customization through material properties
- Optimize models for performance with proper LOD

For 7-10 year old players, robot designs should be visually distinctive but not overly complex.
