# Combat System Integration

Integrate the battle system with existing game components including physics, robot customization, and the game world to create a cohesive experience.

## Integration with Physics System
- Use physics impulses for knockback and impact reactions
- Implement ragdoll effects for defeated enemies
- Create physics-based destruction for environment during combat
- Design combat moves that leverage momentum and weight
- Implement physics constraints for grappling moves
- Create environmental hazards that use physics interactions
- Design transformation mechanics that affect physical properties

## Integration with Customization System
- Map part stats directly to combat capabilities
- Create special abilities tied to specific part combinations
- Implement visual damage on specific robot parts
- Design combat advantages for strategic part selection
- Create faction-specific combat abilities
- Implement performance variations based on part weight/size
- Design upgrade paths that affect combat effectiveness

## Integration with Game World
- Create arena-like battle locations within the city
- Implement environmental advantages/hazards in different zones
- Design destructible elements that affect battle strategy
- Create reactive environments that respond to combat
- Implement spectator NPCs that react to battles
- Design quest-related combat scenarios
- Create tutorial zones for learning combat mechanics

## State Management Integration
- Design combat state that preserves between sessions
- Implement progression system tied to battle performance
- Create statistics tracking for combat analytics
- Design achievement system for combat milestones
- Implement enemy respawn/persistence logic
- Create save systems for mid-battle scenarios
- Design faction reputation affected by battle outcomes

## Performance Considerations
- Optimize for multiple simultaneous combatants
- Implement LOD for distant battles
- Create efficient damage calculation systems
- Design optimized effect spawning during combat
- Implement combat boundary systems to limit scope
- Create combat instance management for multiple battles
- Design efficient serialization of combat state
