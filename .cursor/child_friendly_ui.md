# Child-Friendly UI Context

Design a React component hierarchy for an intuitive, colorful UI suitable for 7-10 year olds, with large buttons, clear instructions, and visual feedback.

Key requirements:
- Create large, clearly labeled buttons with visual icons
- Use dark, futuristic, exciting, contrasting colors for UI elements
- Implement simple, readable fonts (min 16px size)
- Design intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces where appropriate
- Add visual and audio feedback for all interactions
- Create progressive tutorials with step-by-step guidance
- Implement help system with visual examples
- Design UI that minimizes required reading
- Create consistent navigation patterns throughout game
- Support tablet/touch interfaces with appropriate hitboxes
- Where possible add problem solving and learning challenges
- The game teaches the user through gaming interactions to read, compute math and simple problem solving

All UI elements should be accessible and understandable for 7-10 year old players with varying reading abilities - but they should strive to want to play and learn from the interface.
