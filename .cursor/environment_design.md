# Environment Design Context

Implement a detailed city environment with multiple zones and interactive elements, optimized for performance and child-friendly exploration.

Key requirements:
- Create modular building system with instanced rendering
- Implement zone-based loading for large environments
- Design clear visual language for interactive elements
- Balance visual fidelity with performance
- Create landmarks for easy navigation by children
- Implement appropriate level-of-detail systems
- Design physics interactions that are intuitive for young players
- Create consistent visual themes across different city zones

Performance considerations:
- Use object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Implement frustum culling for off-screen elements
- Consider occlusion culling for complex city scenes
- Use texture atlases to minimize draw calls
- Implement proper garbage collection for removed environment objects

Child-friendly design elements:
- Clear color coding for different zones
- Consistent visual language for interactive objects
- Appropriate scale for robot-sized characters
- Visual feedback for destructible elements
- Simple mini-map or waypoint system
