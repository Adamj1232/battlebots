# Three.js Setup Context

Create a Three.js setup that initializes a scene, camera, and renderer. Include responsive canvas resizing, basic lighting setup, and an efficient render loop.

Key requirements:
- Initialize WebGL renderer with appropriate settings for game performance
- Set up PerspectiveCamera with child-friendly FOV (60-70 degrees)
- Create basic scene with ambient and directional lighting
- Implement responsive canvas that adjusts to window size
- Set up efficient requestAnimationFrame render loop
- Initialize stats monitoring for development
- Create organized module structure for scene components
- Add basic scene helpers during development

The game targets children 7-10 years old, so performance must be optimized for lower-end devices.
