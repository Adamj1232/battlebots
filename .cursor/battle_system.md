# Battle System Implementation

Design and implement an engaging combat system appropriate for 7-10 year old players while maintaining strategic depth and visual excitement.

## Core Combat Requirements
- Design attacks with clear cause and effect
- Create generous hit detection for young players
- Implement visual targeting aids for aiming
- Balance combat pace for younger reflexes
- Create obvious visual feedback for all combat actions
- Implement "tells" before enemy attacks
- Design forgiving timing windows for defensive actions

## Technical Implementation
- Use physics impulses for knockback effects
- Implement raycasting for ranged weapon targeting
- Create hitbox system separate from physics colliders
- Design modular damage system based on part attributes
- Implement particle effects manager for visual feedback
- Create camera shake and screen effects for impact
- Use audio positioning for directional attack awareness

## Ability System
- Design abilities with clear function and feedback
- Implement cooldown visualization appropriate for children
- Create ability combinations that are discoverable
- Balance resource management to prevent frustration
- Design transformation mechanics with strategic advantages
- Implement status effect system with clear visual indicators
- Create faction-specific abilities that reinforce faction identity

## Combat Balance
- Design counter mechanics between different robot types
- Implement progressive difficulty scaling
- Create comeback mechanics for trailing players
- Balance risk/reward for special abilities
- Design appropriate reward feedback for successful combat
- Implement gradual introduction of mechanics (tutorial)
- Create balanced AI that challenges but doesn't frustrate

## Child-Friendly Considerations
- Avoid frustrating "cheap" deaths
- Implement optional combat assists for younger players
- Design clear visual language for attack types
- Create consistent feedback for damage taken/given
- Implement intuitive controls with minimal combinations
- Design battles with appropriate length for attention spans
- Create positive reinforcement for strategic thinking
