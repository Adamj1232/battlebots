# Physics Tuning Context

Implement and tune physics for a game targeting 7-10 year old players, balancing realism with playability.

Key requirements:
- Implement forgiving yet believable physics
- Create consistent collision responses
- Design appropriate mass and inertia for robots
- Tune friction and restitution for smooth movement
- Implement constraints for robot joints
- Balance gravity for satisfying jumps
- Create predictable physics interactions
- Optimize collision shapes for performance

Implementation priorities:
- Stability over perfect simulation
- Consistent behavior over physical accuracy
- Performance over complexity
- Feedback clarity over subtle effects

Child-friendly considerations:
- More forgiving fall mechanics
- Slightly exaggerated jump heights
- Generous collision margins
- Clear visual feedback for physics interactions
- Simplified constraints for transformation animations
- Predictable object behavior
